> The history of the Caribbean reveals the region's significant role 
> in the colonial struggles of the European powers since the 15th century. 
> 
> In the modern era, it remains strategically and economically important. 
> 
> In 1492, Christopher Columbus landed in the Caribbean and claimed the region for Spain. 
> The following year, the first Spanish settlements were established in the Caribbean. 
> 
> Although the Spanish conquests of the Aztec empire and the Inca empire 
> in the early sixteenth century made Mexico and Peru more desirable places 
> for Spanish exploration and settlement, the Caribbean remained strategically important.
>
> From the 1620s and 1630s onwards, non-Hispanic privateers, traders, and settlers 
> established permanent colonies and trading posts on the Caribbean islands neglected by Spain. 
> 
> Such colonies spread throughout the Caribbean, 
> from the Bahamas in the northwest to Tobago in the southeast. 
> 
> Furthermore, during this period, French, Dutch, and English buccaneers settled on 
> - the island of Tortuga, 
> - the northern and western coasts of Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic), 
> - and later in Jamaica 
> - as well as the island of Martinica.
>
> After the Spanish–American War in 1898, 
> the islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico were no longer part of the Spanish Empire. 
> 
> In the 20th century, the Caribbean was again important during World War II, 
> in the decolonization wave after the war, 
> and in the tension between Communist Cuba and the United States. 
> 
> The exploitation of the labor of Indigenous peoples 
> and the demographic collapse of that population, 
> forced migration of enslaved Africans, 
> immigration of Europeans, Chinese, South Asians, and others, 
> and rivalry amongst world powers since the sixteenth century 
> have given Caribbean history an impact disproportionate to its size. 
> 
> Many islands have attained independence from colonial powers and sovereignty; 
> others have formal political ties with major powers, including the United States. 
> 
> The early economic structure integrating the Caribbean into the Atlantic world 
> and world economic system continues to impact the modern Caribbean region.
