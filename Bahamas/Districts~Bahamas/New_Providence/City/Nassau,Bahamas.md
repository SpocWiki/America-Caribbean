## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Nassau (NASS-aw) is the capital and largest city of The Bahamas. 
> 
> It is on the island of New Providence, which has a population of 296,522, 
> which is 74.26% of the country's population. 
> 
> Nassau is commonly defined as a primate city, dwarfing all other towns in the country. 
> It is the centre of commerce, education, law, administration, and media of the country.
>
> Lynden Pindling International Airport, the major airport for The Bahamas, 
> is located about 16 km (9.9 mi) west of the city centre of Nassau, 
> and has daily flights to and from major cities in Canada, the Caribbean, the United Kingdom 
> and the United States. 
> 
> Nassau is the site of the House of Assembly and various judicial departments 
> and was considered historically to be a stronghold of pirates. 
> The city was named in honour of William III of England, Prince of Orange-Nassau.
>
> Nassau's modern growth began in the late eighteenth century, 
> with the influx of thousands of Loyalists and their slaves to The Bahamas 
> following the American War of Independence. 
> Many of them settled in Nassau and eventually came to outnumber the original inhabitants.
>
> As the population of Nassau grew, so did its populated areas. 
> Today, the city dominates the entire island. 
> 
> However, until the post-Second World War era, the outer suburbs scarcely existed. 
> Most of New Providence was uncultivated bush 
> until Loyalists were resettled there following the American Revolutionary War; 
> they established several plantations, such as Clifton and Tusculum. 
> Slaves were imported as labour.
>
> After the British abolished the international slave trade in 1807, 
> they resettled thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships by the Royal Navy 
> on New Providence (at Adelaide Village and Gambier Village), 
> along with other islands such as Grand Bahama, Exuma, Abaco and Inagua. 
> 
> In addition, slaves freed from American ships, 
> such as the slave ship Creole in November 1841, were allowed to settle there. 
> 
> The largest concentration of Africans historically lived in the "Over-the-Hill" suburbs of 
> Grants Town and Bain Town to the south of the city of Nassau, 
> while most of the inhabitants of European descent lived on the island's northern coastal ridges.
