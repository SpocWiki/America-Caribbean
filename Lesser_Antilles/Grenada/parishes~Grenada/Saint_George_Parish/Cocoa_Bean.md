> The cocoa bean, also known as cocoa or cacao, 
> is the dried and fully fermented seed of [[../../../../../../../bio/bio~Domain/Eukarya/Plant/Land_Plant/Seed_Plant/Flowering_Plant/Eudicots/Core_Eudicots/Rosids/Malvales/Malvaceae/Byttnerioideae/Theobromateae/Theobroma/Cacao_Tree|Theobroma]], the cacao tree, 
> from which cocoa solids (a mixture of nonfat substances) 
> and cocoa butter (the fat) can be extracted. 
> 
> Cacao trees are native to the Amazon rainforest. 
> They are the basis of [[../../../../../../../Society/Economics/Home_Economics/Cooking/Food/Candy/Chocolate|Chocolate]] and Mesoamerican foods including tejate, 
> an indigenous Mexican drink.
>
> The cacao tree was first domesticated at least 5,300 years ago 
> by the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in South America before it was introduced in Mesoamerica. 
> 
> Cacao was consumed by pre-Hispanic cultures in spiritual ceremonies, 
> and its beans were a common currency in Mesoamerica. 
> 
> The cacao tree grows in a limited geographical zone; 
> today, West Africa produces nearly 81% of the world's crop. 
> The three main varieties of cocoa plants are Forastero, Criollo, and Trinitario, 
> with Forastero being the most widely used.
>
> In 2024, global cocoa bean production reached 5.8 million tonnes, 
> with Ivory Coast leading at 38% of the total, followed by Ghana and Indonesia. 
> 
> Cocoa beans, cocoa butter, and cocoa powder are traded on futures markets, 
> with London focusing on West African cocoa and New York on Southeast Asian cocoa. 
> 
> Various international and national initiatives aim to support sustainable cocoa production, 
> including the Swiss Platform for Sustainable Cocoa (SWISSCO), 
> the German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa (GISCO), and Belgium's Beyond Chocolate. 
> 
> At least 29% of global cocoa production was compliant with voluntary sustainability standards in 2016. 
> 
> Deforestation due to cocoa production remains a concern, especially in West Africa. 
> Sustainable agricultural practices, such as agroforestry, 
> can support cocoa production while conserving biodiversity. 
> 
> Cocoa contributes significantly to economies such as Nigeria's, 
> and demand for cocoa products has grown at over 3% annually since 2008.
>
> Cocoa contains phytochemicals like flavanols, procyanidins, and other flavonoids, 
> and flavanol-rich chocolate and cocoa products may have a small blood pressure lowering effect. 
> 
> The beans also contain theobromine and a small amount of caffeine. 
> The tree takes five years to grow and has a typical lifespan of 100 years.
